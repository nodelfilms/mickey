<p>Hello! I'm Elena Nodel, founder of Nodel Films.</p>

<p>It happens that after almost 20 years of successful legal career I moved in filmmaking. 
I made my first short video while being a lawyer for anniversary of the company for which I worked. 
I felt in love with the process and the result of filmmaking so much that I can't stop till now.</p>

<p>My short film &#8220;The Talent&#8221; was participated in Short Film Corner in Cannes Festival and in 
official selection of Diversity in Cannes showcase.</p>

<p>School children, lawyers, employees of different corporations, moms and dads are participated in 
my musical videos and short films. Most of them couldn't even imagine that they can be movie stars.</p>

<p>I adore to see how ordinary people are opening their minds and souls during our shots, 
how they are happy to be a part of filmmaking process and proud with the result.</p>

<p>Cinema is always a feast. Sometimes the filmmaking process is really hard job, 
but it's always a happiness.</p>

<p>If you want to know my full story, please,
