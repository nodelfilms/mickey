&#8216;This is an interesting modern fairytale&#8217;.<br/><br/>

&#8216;I was really drawn into this film because I wanted to figure out the catch. When it was finally revealed it warmed my heart. A good feel film that makes one reflect on his/her own talents&#8217;.<br/><br/>

&#8216;Lovely film starring actors who are over the age of 40. Refreshing to see this done with the casting!&#8217;<br/><br/>

&#8216;Enjoyable, with a nice message about belief in one's self&#8217;.<br/><br/>

&#8216;I enjoyed this film from the dialogue and performances to the music and the message. Different from what I've seen. Very original and creative&#8217;.<br/><br/>

Short film &#8220;The Talent&#8221; can be named a true &#8220;art-house&#8221; as  Elena Nodel was screenwriter, 
director, producer of the film and even wrote a song by herself. 
Elena is proud that  people who watched her film feel that &#8220;The Talent&#8221;
gives creative energy and inspiration.
