Wow! That was largest amount of actors we ever filmed before in one short film - 44! And this is not including the film crew. Hardest part was filming in the class. Unlike dancing part, here everyone need to sit still and do exactly what they been told to do. Well, for children that is a challenge. But we did it!

Film is based on the cover of famous "Drop it like it's hot" by Snoop Dog and Pharrell Williams, however we wrote completely different lyrics "Ode to Lyceum" with some references to Alexaned Pushkin "Ode to Lyceum" and humor and irony about dayly life of Liceum's pupils.

Song was performed in professional recording studio. Kudos to Stas Svintsov for great work with singers, it helped them a lot to get into proper mood for gangsta rap song.

Most of the action were shoot at so-called "Cyclorama" - a white Chorma Key studio that is build the way there is no visible threshold between background walls and the floor.
