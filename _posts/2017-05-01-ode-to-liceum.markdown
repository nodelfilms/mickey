Wow! That was largest amount of actors we ever filmed before in one short film - 44! And this is not including the film crew. Hardest part was filming in the class. Unlike dancing part, here everyone need to sit still and do exactly what they been told to do. Well, for children that is a challenge. But we did it!

Film is based on the cover of Snoop Dog's "Drop it like it's hot", however we wrote completely different lyrics "Ode to Lyceum" with some references to Alexaned Pushkin "Ode to Lyceum" and humor and irony about dayly life of Liceum's pupils.
